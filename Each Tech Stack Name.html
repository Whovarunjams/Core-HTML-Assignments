        <h1 style="color: blueviolet;">What is a Tech Stack?</h1>
        <dl>
            A tech stack refers to a set of tools, programming languages, and technologies that work together <br> to build digital products or solutions such as websites, mobile, and web apps.
            A tech stack consists <br> of two equally important elements: the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Both work <br> together to create a working tech stack. This is also referred to as an application stack.
            While there <br> are different tech stacks for web development, not all of them are created equally. The choice of an <br> applicable tech stack can be challenging, particularly for startups and small businesses. They have <br> limited budget and resources, thus, choosing the right tech stack is crucial to mobilize their software <br> projects.

            Frontend Tech Stack
        </h1>
        <dl>
            The frontend tech stack is the client's side of the application. Client-side refers to anything that a user <br> can see or engage with on a screen. The main concern of the frontend stack is to create a stellar <br> user experience, smooth user interface, and straightforward internal structures. In other words, <br> it is responsible for the design, format, and navigation of websites or web apps. <br><br>There are three principal elements of a frontend stack. These are:
        </dl>
        <li>
            <u>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</u> - it's a markup language for creating and displaying electronic <br> documents (web pages). They are the backbone in the organization and placement of content on a web page. <br><br>
        </li>
        <li><u>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</u> - It is responsible for the format and layout of the web pages. It includes <br> the font styles, sizes, layout, color, and other aspects of a web page. Developers commonly use frameworks <br> like SASS and LESS to make CSS more manageable and more dynamic.</li> <br>
        <li><u>JavaScript</u> – Used to make web pages interactive. It’s a programming language that allows you <br>to implement dynamic features on web pages; with common libraries and frameworks like jQuery, <br> React, Angular, and Vue. Many modern applications now also use TypeScript instead of basic JavaScript. </li>
        <dl>
            Being an expert at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is its own specialization these days. There are lots of developers <br> that excel at only front-end work. They are known as front end developers. They commonly specialize in Angular <br> or React and call server APIs built by other developers.

        <h1 style="color: blueviolet;">Backend Tech Stack</h1>
        <dl>
            The server-side of software development is the backend tech stack. It refers to the inner workings of a website or <br> app that users cannot see. Think of it as the electric power stations that generate electricity for your home. They <br> may seem invisible in the background, but they are important to keep the operations running smoothly. <br><br> The backend stack includes these elements:
        </dl>
        <table>
           <li><u>Programming languages</u> – This creates logic for apps and websites. The code link the web to a database. <br> Some examples are JavaScript, PHP, and Python. </li> <br>
            <li><u>Frameworks</u> – it provides support of applications based on a single programming language. Laravel, <br> Django, and Ruby on Rails are few of the popular frameworks. Most modern applications are built using <br> an MVC style framework.</li><br>
            <li><u>Web Servers</u> – You need backend servers to manage client requests. Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft's <br> Internet Information Server (IIS) are the most common web servers.</li><br>
            <li><u>Databases</u> – Most applications require a SQL or NoSQL database. MongoDB, PostgreSQL, <br> and MySQL are common databases.</li><br>
